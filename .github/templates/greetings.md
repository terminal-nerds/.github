## Code of Conduct

Before we get started, here is a little reminder.\
**Our team has adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct]**.

## Things to remember

1. üí° **Please mark the Pull Request as a `draft` if it is not ready.**\
   In other words, when it still is a work in progress _(WIP)_.\
   List your [TODO] list, so other contributors can help you speed it up.

1. ‚ùó **Any Pull Request title needs to follow our [Git commits messages
   convention].**\
   We're using the _"Squash and merge"_ strategy, so what matters the most to us
   is the title.

If you're lost and have some questions, please see if you can find your
answer in the [Contribution guide].
Otherwise, please reach out to us on our [Discord server]. We have a
[`#contributing` channel][discord server] under the "_üí¨ - Discussions"_ group.
